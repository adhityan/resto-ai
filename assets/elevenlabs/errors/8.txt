## Test setup
Agent - Hey! You've got Miri Mary. This is Aldert. How can I help you?
User - I want some information about Miri Mary. If I want to book a reservation for 11 people, is there any mandatory restriction?

## Agent's actual response in the test 
For parties of 11, we do need to coordinate with our manager to ensure we can accommodate you properly. I can help you with that—would you like to proceed with booking for 11 people?

## Status
Test failed. For large calls, the LLM agent is expected to transfer the call. However in this case, it asked the user if it can help him make the booking.
