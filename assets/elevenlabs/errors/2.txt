Agent - Hey! You've got Miri Mary. This is Saar. How can I help you?
User - Hey, what's the address?
Agent - Van der Helstplein 15H in De Pijp, Amsterdam. It's right on the square, easy to find.
User - Okay, nice. What's the menu like at the restaurant?
Agent - We specialize in modern Indian cuisine with a focus on sharing plates. Our brunch features the famous Butter Chicken Benny, and dinner highlights our 12-hour Black Lentils. We’ve got plenty of vegetarian and vegan options too—actually, that’s one of our specialties.
User - Okay great! You know what menu would you recommend for say three people?
Agent - For three people, I’d suggest starting with the 12-hour Black Lentils and Butter Chicken as main dishes. Then add a few sharing starters like Gunpowder Okra Fries and Tandoori Mushrooms with Saffron Cream. Finish with the Strawberry & Mango Buttermilk Pancakes for brunch, or a sweet treat if you're dining in the evening. It’s a great mix of flavors and textures.
User - Oh great! You know let's make a reservation.
Agent - Perfect! What date would you like to book for?
User - ...
Agent - Just checking in—do you have a date in mind for your reservation?
User -  Maybe next Tuesday?
Agent - Hhmmmm...yeah give me a second...
