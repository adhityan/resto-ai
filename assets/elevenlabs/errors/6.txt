## Test name
Interuption after check availability

## Expected next response 
When you are interupted after calling check availability, do not respond with "I am here", etc. Instead respond back with the output of the tool call as you would have before the interuption.

## Success Examples 
I am checking up on availability. I see there is a table for 2 available for that time. Do you want to book?

## Failure Examples
I'm here. Would you like to check availability after 8 p.m.?

Agent - We've got space for four people on Monday at 7:30 PM on the heated patio or for dinner inside. Which would you prefer?
User - I need a table for two only. I'd say 8 p.m.

}

Agent - That time is booked. We have space at 7:30 PM on the patio or inside for dinner. Would you like one of those?
User - Do you have times after 8 p.m.?
Agent - Checking availability...
User - ...

## Agent's actual response in the test 
Just checking if you're still there? I can help you find a time after 8 p.m. if you'd like.

## Status
Test failed. It could have inferred that there are no other times available dates for that day from the "otherAvailableSlotsForThatDay": [] in one of the latter check-availability calls. But more importantly, in this test, it did not make the last check-availability call. When the user interuppted with "...", it lost track of its intent to make the check-availability call and just asked the user again if he wanted to check for availability. This failed this test.
