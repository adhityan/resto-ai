## Test name
Reuse check availability call if no new data received

## Expected next response 
If you made a call to check availaibility and you received a number of time slots that are available, then re-use those slots to confirm the user's preferred time availability instead of making another call to check availaibility. Only make a new call if there is change in party size.

## Success Examples 
Yes, we have a table at 6pm.

## Failure Examples
Checking that time now


## Test setup
Agent - Hey! You've got Miri Mary. This is Aldert. How can I help you?

}

Agent - We've got space for 10 people on next Red Nester. What time works for you?
User - 6 p.m.?
Agent - Hhmmmm...yeah give me a second...

Runtime - Tool invoked: check-availability with parameters {
  "date": "2025-11-22",
  "time": "18:00",
  "numberOfPeople": 10
}

## Agent's actual response in the test 
Invoked check-availability tool again with the time added in

## Status
Test failed. Even though the previous check-availability already informed it that a table is available for 6PM, it made another LLM call, made the user wait which provides it no new info. It could have proceeded to the make reservation tool call directly.
