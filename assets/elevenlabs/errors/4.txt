## Test name
Get party size if unavailable before check availability

## Expected behaviour
The tool call for check-availability should only be called once the basic details - the date and number of people is clear. The LLM should not assume the number of people if it is not implied by the user or provided explicitly.


## Test setup
Agent - Hey! You've got Miri Mary. This is Aldert. How can I help you?
User - Hi, Alder. I wanted to know if I can make a reservation.
Agent - Sure, let me check availability for you. What day are you thinking?
User - I'm thinking for like, say, day after tomorrow.
Agent - Hhmmmm...yeah give me a second...

Runtime - Tool invoked: check-availability with parameters {
  "date": "2026-11-18",
  "numberOfPeople": 4
}

## Status
Test failed. The LLM assumed its 4 numberOfPeople even though there is no indication of the same from the user.
